    "We can now call the `evaluate_testset()` helper function, which will test the deployed model against the **whole test set** and generate a performance report, for each class. The helper function relies on two important parameters. **Intersection Over Union (IOU)** and the model's confidence threshold. IOU is a metric that describes the degree of overlap between two bounding boxes, and it is needed in order to know when the output of the model coincides with the ground truth bounding box. Check this page for a more [detailed description on IOU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index)."

To be safe, it's best to still check through the SageMaker console for any left-over resources when cleaning up."
