## Computer vision for retail inventory workshop

This repository accompanies the [Computer vision in retail inventory](https://catalog.us-east-1.prod.workshops.aws/workshops/f64d7705-d176-4775-a124-314cf5f404f8) workshop. The workshop takes you through the steps required to build a basic computer vision model which can detect a set of 10 common supermarket products. Then you will deploy your model and integrate it with a web application which counts the number of products on a shelf. Finally, you can challenge yourself to build a better model, or expand the model to solve additional use cases. 

Please follow the setup instructions in the workshop documentation before using this repository, which contains the Jupyter notebooks required to train and deploy the models.
